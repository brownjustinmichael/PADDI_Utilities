   contain the root `toctree` directive.

PADDI Utilities
================
This suite of analysis routines is designed to provide a useful python interface to the 3D double-diffusive code PADDI. Each of the major modules in this suite are designed with a particular emphasis in mind and are for the most part independent.

The :mod:`data <paddi_utils.data>` module reads the output files from PADDI into common datatypes in python.

The :mod:`plots <paddi_utils.plots>` module provides a series of visualization tools for the various modules in the suite.

For some (hopefully) working examples, try out some of the python scripts in the "scripts" directory. Most of these should be somewhat self explanatory and provide examples on how to use the tools of this suite.
